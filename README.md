- This assignment set the task of producing a full stack CRUD app that allows users to enter their name and a message. The names and messages and messages of the user and other users are saved using a database and then displayed on the page.

Requirements:

- Ensured HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
- Confirmed that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes with dynamic CSS styling. This was achieved with the '#message-form' styling in css by using 'display:flex;'.
- Created a working GET API route in your server.
- Created a working POST API route in your client.
- Seeded the database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor.

Reflection:

- The hardest part of this task was getting the API routes to function properly, and correctly sanitising SQL injection.
